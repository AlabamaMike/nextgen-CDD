Expert Call Transcript: Supply Chain Analyst
Date: December 2024
Duration: 40 minutes

Interviewer: Thanks for making time today. You cover Apple's supply chain extensively. Can you give us an overview of their manufacturing footprint?

Sarah Martinez (Senior Analyst, Supply Chain Research): Absolutely. Apple's supply chain is one of the most complex in the world. They have over 200 major suppliers across 40+ countries. The key assembly partners are Foxconn, Pegatron, and Luxshare in China, with growing capacity in India and Vietnam.

Interviewer: We've heard a lot about Apple diversifying away from China. How real is that?

Sarah Martinez: It's happening but slowly. Right now, about 90% of iPhones are still assembled in China. India now produces roughly 7% of iPhones, up from essentially zero five years ago. Vietnam handles AirPods and some MacBooks. But here's the thing - moving the supply chain is a decade-long project.

Interviewer: What are the risks of the China concentration?

Sarah Martinez: There are three main risks. First, geopolitical - if US-China relations deteriorate further, tariffs or export restrictions could devastate production. Second, COVID showed us that lockdowns can halt production for weeks. Third, rising labor costs in China are squeezing margins.

Interviewer: Can you quantify the labor cost differential?

Sarah Martinez: Sure. A Foxconn worker in Zhengzhou earns about $3.50-4.00 per hour all-in. In India, it's closer to $1.50-2.00. But productivity in India is still 15-20% lower, so the net savings are modest right now. Vietnam is somewhere in between.

Interviewer: How does Apple maintain quality control across such a distributed network?

Sarah Martinez: This is actually Apple's secret weapon. They have thousands of engineers embedded at supplier facilities. They own many of the specialized machines. When you buy a component from a supplier, it's often made on Apple-owned equipment to Apple specifications. This creates dependency but also consistency.

Interviewer: What about component shortages? We saw issues during COVID.

Sarah Martinez: The chip shortage was devastating for the whole industry, but Apple fared better than most. Their advance purchasing commitments - we're talking $50 billion+ annually - give them priority allocation. They also have multi-year contracts with TSMC for leading-edge nodes.

Interviewer: Speaking of TSMC, how critical is that relationship?

Sarah Martinez: It's existential. TSMC manufactures 100% of Apple's custom silicon - the A-series, M-series, and now Apple Intelligence chips. If TSMC had a major disruption - earthquake, invasion, anything - Apple would have zero alternatives. Samsung's foundry is a generation behind.

Interviewer: That sounds like significant concentration risk.

Sarah Martinez: It absolutely is. Intel is trying to build competitive foundry capacity, but they're 3-4 years from being Apple-ready. TSMC is building in Arizona, but that fab won't be fully operational until 2025-2026, and it's 4nm while TSMC Taiwan is already on 3nm.

Interviewer: What's happening with Apple's vertical integration strategy?

Sarah Martinez: They're bringing more in-house every year. They design their own chips, of course. They acquired the Intel modem business and are developing their own 5G modems to replace Qualcomm. They make their own displays through partnerships. The strategy is to own the key differentiating components.

Interviewer: How does this affect suppliers?

Sarah Martinez: It's brutal for them. Dialog Semiconductor was acquired after Apple brought power management in-house. Imagination Technologies nearly went bankrupt when Apple dropped them for GPU. Qualcomm's modem business faces existential risk. Being an Apple supplier is lucrative but precarious.

Interviewer: What's your outlook on Apple's cost structure?

Sarah Martinez: They've maintained roughly 38-42% gross margins despite component cost inflation. They do this through scale, vertical integration, and frankly, passing costs to consumers. The iPhone 15 Pro Max BOM is about $500, selling for $1,200. That's incredible pricing power.

Interviewer: Any supply chain trends that could disrupt Apple?

Sarah Martinez: Watch the rare earth situation. China controls 60% of rare earth production and 90% of processing. These materials are critical for electronics. If China restricted exports, everyone would suffer, but Apple's scale makes them more exposed in absolute terms.

Interviewer: Thank you for this detailed overview.

Sarah Martinez: My pleasure. Let me know if you need any follow-up data.
